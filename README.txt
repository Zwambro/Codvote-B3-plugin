Vote plugin for Call of Duty Servers

Note: Requires B3 v1.10.x

Usage:

!vote maps - Show the maps that can be voted on.
!veto - Cancels the vote in progress


Plugin behavior:
- A vote will remain active for "votetime" specified in config. The vote will fail if not enough players vote within that time.
  An extra 5 seconds for players to read what they are voting for will be added.

- Only players that were in the server at the time the vote was called will be able to vote.
   If anyone enters the server after vote is initiated will not be allowed to vote.

- Admin at level 20 and up will not be affected by a kick vote. The plugin will refuse to initiate the vote against an admin.

- There must be more than 1 players in game for vote to work. Unless vote is called by superadmin.
